        <h1 class="heading">HTML</h1>
        <p class="content">The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the 
            standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed 
            in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as 
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
            local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
            originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

        <h1 class="heading">CSS</h1>
        <p class="content">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet 
            language used for describing the presentation of a document 
            written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a 
            cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside 
            HTML and JavaScript.
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation 
            and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This 
            separation can improve content accessibility; provide 
            more flexibility and control in the specification of 
            presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages 
            to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a 
            separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition 
            in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be 
            cached to improve the page load speed between the pages 
            that share the file and its formatting.

        <h1 class="heading">JavaScript</h1>
        <p class="content">JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is 
            a programming language that is one of the core 
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and 
            CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client 
            side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating 
            third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers 
            have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the 
            code on users' devices.
