            <p class="content">The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the 
                standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed 
                in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as 
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
                local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
                HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
                originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

            <h1 class="heading">CSS</h1>
            <p class="content">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet 
                language used for describing the presentation of a document 
                written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a 
                cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside 
                HTML and JavaScript.
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation 
                and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This 
                separation can improve content accessibility; provide 
                more flexibility and control in the specification of 
                presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages 
                to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a 
                separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition 
                in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be 
                cached to improve the page load speed between the pages 
                that share the file and its formatting.

            <h1 class="heading">JavaScript</h1>
            <p class="content">JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is 
                a programming language that is one of the core 
                technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and 
                CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client 
                side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating 
                third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers 
                have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the 
                code on users' devices.
